      <h3>
        Hotelling's Law: what do a mathematician, Pizza Hut, and the New Zealand
        National Party have in common?
      </h3>
      <h4>1. Pizza</h4>
      <p>
        On Northland Road there are three pizza shops next to one another. All
        the major brands are represented: Pizza Hut, Domino’s, Hell’s. How did
        they all end up in the same spot? Hotelling's Law is an observation that
        in many markets it is rational for producers to make their products as
        similar as possible and their stores as close together as possible.
      </p>
      <p>from Wikipedia:</p>
      <blockquote>
        'Suppose there are two competing shops located along the length of a
        street, with customers spread equally along the street. Both shop owners
        want their shops to be where they will get the most market share of
        customers. If both shops sell the same range of goods at the same prices
        then the locations of the shops are themselves the 'products'. Each
        customer will always choose the nearer shop as it is disadvantageous to
        travel to the farther.'
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        For a single shop, the shop owner is indifferent about the location of
        the shop since it will draw all customers to it by default.
        Interestingly, though, Hotelling's law predicts that a street with two
        shops will also find both shops right next to each other at the same
        halfway point. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine there are two ice-cream carts, one at each end of a beach. If
        there is an equal distribution of rational consumers along the beach,
        each ice-cream cart will get half the customers, divided by an invisible
        line equidistant from the carts. But, each ice-cream cart owner will be
        tempted to push their cart slightly towards the other, moving the
        invisible line so that the owner is on the side with more than half the
        beach. Eventually, the ice-cream carts will end up next to each other in
        the centre of the beach.
      </p>
      <img src="/essays/hotelling/images/icecream.png" width="500" />
      <p>
        The same thing played out with the three pizza shops on Northland Road.
        The strip of shops on Northland Road lies on the intersection of three
        suburbs: Northland, Karori, and Kelburn. This makes it an optimal
        mid-point for a single vendor to put their pizza shop. When there are
        three vendors, they end up next to each other because to deviate from
        the midpoint would mean conceding market share to their competitors. It
        would be more socially beneficial if the pizza shops separated
        themselves—each could still draw one third of the customers but
        customers would, on average, make a shorter journey. However, no shop
        would be willing to do this independently as it would then allow the
        others to capture more than their fair share of the market.

      <h4>2. How Do Political Parties Change?</h4>
      <p>
        This section gets technical, so feel free to skip to the final
        paragraph. If you’re the sort of reader I want though, you’ll think I
        don’t go far enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hotelling's Law is connected to an idea from political science: policy
        convergence. Politics is a marketplace. To achieve a critical size and
        to command the parliamentary majority, parties must bid for support from
        a diverse electorate. They adjust their appeal to changes in the public
        sentiments or priorities which seem likely to influence voting patterns.
        The whole object is to produce a slate of policies which, perhaps, only
        a minority would have chosen as their preferred options but which the
        broadest possible range of people can live with. In more technical
        language, spatial models of political competition predict that parties
        are vote-seeking, positioning themselves to capture the interests of the
        median voter. The median voter may be the median voter politically, in
        terms of left-right, or it may be the median-*income* voter. Parties are
        not necessarily vote-seeking though. They may be office-seeking, vying
        to become a coalition partner. Or they may be policy-seeking, advancing
        particular policy objectives that are linked to underlying ideological
        positions. (Rather than appealing to the median voter, policy-seeking
        parties seek to move the median voter towards their policy positions).
        Yet even if vote-seeking does not constitute the end goal in itself,
        maximising the vote share remains an efficient strategy for office- and
        policy-seeking parties. Consequently, we expect parties to naturally
        converge around the median voter, and the evidence shows that this is
        often the case.
      </p>
      <h4>Globalisation and Party convergence</h4>
      <p>
        It is often asserted that globalisation has led political parties to
        converge on a swath of centre-right, neoliberal policies.
        “Globalisation” encompasses four interrelated structural shifts that
        roughly occurred since the 1980s. First, the internationalisation of
        markets and subsequent decline in the importance of borders includes
        changes in laws, institutions, or practices that make various
        transactions easier or less expensive across borders. The growth of
        international regulatory institutions and political agreements to
        facilitate capital flows have liberalised and internationalised
        financial markets, resulting in more financial openness. Second, the
        toughening of tax competition is often accompanied by neoliberal
        tendencies. The mobility of labour and capital is the antecedent to
        competition. Central neoliberal measures to enhance competition include
        deregulation, liberalisation, and privatisation. Third, the rising
        worldwide interconnectedness through Information and Communication
        Technologies, which have accelerated the liberalisation of financial
        transactions and communication. Fourth, the increasing relevance and
        volatility of markets. The graph below illustrates increasing
        globalisation over time using the KOF index for New Zealand and the
        world average.
      </p>
      <img src="/essays/hotelling/images/KOF.png" width="500" />
      <p>
        We have become more globalised, but how has this influenced the
        left/right position of party policies? To make sense of the empirical
        work, we first need to look at why globalisation would cause parties to
        shift politically—and in which direction.
      </p>
      <h4>Theoretically speaking</h4>
      <p>
        There are two competing theories explaining why political convergence
        has occurred and in which direction parties have shifted. **Efficiency
        Theory** says that governments are faced with increasingly limited room
        to manoeuvre as a result of globalisation. By privileging the free
        movement of capital and labour, globalisation has created a race to the
        bottom in social protections. To attract capital, countries are forced
        to deregulate their economies to maximise competitiveness. There is a
        race to the bottom in terms of wages, working conditions, and welfare.
        Countries therefore converge on a neoliberal mix of policy offerings,
        characterised by spending cuts, lower taxes, balanced budgets, and a
        general weakening of the state’s productivity and redistributive
        capacity. In contrast, **compensation theory** says that because
        economic globalisation produces winners and losers, governments
        intervene to redistribute wealth and compensate the losers of
        globalisation. Governments face electoral pressure from globalisation
        losers to create or expand social programs to maintain their security
        and help them adjust. Compensation theory predicts that as globalisation
        increases, party policies will shift to the left to compensate for the
        losers of globalisation. According to Adams, Haupt, and Stoll, parties
        of the left are historically more policy-seeking than vote-seeking. This
        is because of organisational ties to trade unions and mass party
        structure with members involved in leadership and candidate selection
        and party policy. Parties of the left give higher priority to being in
        close agreement with their supporters while parties of the right give
        higher priority to the median voter. Consequently, parties of the left
        have historically been less dynamically responsive to short-term shifts
        in public opinion.
      </p>
      <h4>Measuring policy convergence</h4>
      <p>The evidence is argued in all directions</p>
      <p>
        There is evidence of an efficiency effect and rightward shift of party
        positions**. Steiner and Martin use panel data from elections in 24
        developed democracies in the period 1950 to 2005. They report that
        economic integration leads to more similar positions of parties on
        economic policies, where parties adopt positions that are more capital
        friendly and deregulatory. Similarly, Hellwig finds that globalisation
        increases the likelihood that parties adopt more neoliberal policy
        positions, supporting the claims of efficiency theory. Other studies
        offer conditional support of efficiency theory. Ward et al. find the
        position of the median voter mediates the effect of parties’ political
        position. Globalisation only affects party competition if the expected
        position of the median voter is far enough to the left, in which case it
        moves left-wing parties—and to a lesser extent right-wing parties—in a
        rightward direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also evidence for a compensation effect and a leftward shift of
        party positions. Adam and Ftergioti, use panel data from 1970 to 2015
        including 36 parties from 18 Western European countries. 16 They
        conclude that globalisation creates convergence of party positions, with
        right-wing parties moving leftward. This is consistent with the
        compensation theory. This finding is supported by Sen and Barry, who
        find that parties on both the left and right increasingly adopt
        traditionally leftist positions in response to economic globalisation.
        Similarly, Haupt finds there is a leftward shift in party policy
        associated with imports and capital mobility, but finds no measurable
        effect from foreign direct investment. This is an interesting finding
        because it disaggregates economic globalisation, generating more
        specific insight. It is important to note that Haupt and Adams et al.
        focused on Western European countries because there may be problems
        arising from conflating globalisation with Europeanisation.
        Consequently, we should be cautious about generalising these findings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent literature on the effects of globalisation points to complex
        responses to globalisations. Investigating whether the effects of
        globalisation differ between economic and noneconomic issues, Hellwig
        reports that economic globalisation reduces party responsiveness to the
        median voter on economic issues. But a case study of Sweden shows that
        on noneconomic issues, political parties become more attentive to the
        preferences of the median voter as economic globalisation increases.
        This finding is supported by Ward et al., who find that increased
        economic integration in the EU is associated with increased emphasis on
        non-economic issues during election campaigns, and economic
        globalisation is associated with rightward convergence of party
        positions on economic issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another study, by Rohlding and Schafföner, reports that different
        aspects of economic globalisation—imports and exports—produce opposite
        effects on party politics. Using a time-series cross-section analysis of
        129 elections in 15 Western European countries from 1974 to 2015, they
        examine the effects of imports and effects on a country’s political
        centre of gravity. They define the political centre of gravity as the
        mean positioning of parties on a specific dimension, with party
        positions weighted by their vote share. Increasing levels of imports are
        associated with a leftwards shift of the centre of gravity and
        decreasing levels of imports with a rightward shift on the economic
        dimension of party competition. The negative perception of imports
        incentivises parties to shelter import-competers from imports by
        creating non-tariff barriers to trade as well as supporting measures
        such as subsidies. They argue that parties have incentives to offer
        policies that shelter voters from import competition, protecting voters
        with jobs that are vulnerable to rising imports. This does not
        necessarily entail increased welfare spending. In contrast to imports,
        they find that changes in the level of exports are unrelated to a
        country’s political centre of gravity on the economic dimension of party
        competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all of the literature supports the claim that parties converge.
        Adams, Haupt, Stoll find that parties of the centre and right adjust
        their ideologies in response to public opinion shifts and economic
        conditions, but left-wing parties do not systematically respond to
        public opinion and appear to respond less to global economic conditions.
        This finding contradicts one of the implications of Efficiency Theory.
        Adams posits that parties of the left may react differently to public
        opinion and the global economy because historically parties of the left
        were more policy-seeking than office-seeking, and because of their
        organisational ties to unions and the mass-party structure, left-wing
        parties prioritise aligning with more vulnerable people who make up
        their core constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The jury is still out on the question of what is driving policy
        convergence. (And the direction of convergence depends on which
        combination—out of many plausible combinations of measures and
        countries—we choose). Yet the weight of the scholarship supports the
        claim that the policies of political parties in developed economies are
        growing more alike.
      </p>
      <h4>3. The National Party's Death Spiral</h4>
      <p>
        In an article titled, ‘’The National Party Death Spiral,” Matthew Hooton
        argues that National is struggling to find its feet because the Labour
        Party have pivoted away from their reformist roots, towards the historic
        platform of the National party: stability. Effectively, Labour have
        moved their ice-cream cart onto National’s side of the beach and stolen
        their customers. Hotelling’s Law represents this idea well. Political
        parties will get as close as possible to the competing party's platform
        while preserving their own identity. This encroachment, coupled with
        National’s 2003 constitutional reforms which took power from party
        members and gave it to party elites, has led to National’s present
        plight.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020 Labour won nearly half a million new voters compared to 2017.
        Where did this support come from? Around 16 percent of 2020 Labour
        voters reported voting for National in 2020. At face value this supports
        the idea that Hotelling’s Law is at play in NZ politics; people who
        typically voted National instead voted Labour. But to ascertain whether
        Labour has set up shop on National’s side of the beach, we need to look
        at their customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The New Zealand Election Study (NZES) lets us to look at a random sample
        of individuals drawn from the electoral roll, and test some factors we
        know influence voting behaviour. 3,731 participants were surveyed in
        2020. Looking at the responses of all voters in the NZES, researchers
        found that of those who switched from National in 2017 to Labour in
        2020, 46 percent placed themselves at the centre of the political
        spectrum, but 25 percent voted for National in both the last two
        elections. Think of this latter group as National’s usual customers—y in
        the diagram below.
      </p>
      <img src="/essays/hotelling/images/balls.png" width="500" />
      <p>
        We can see that Labour has taken some of National’s old customers—but
        how? The NZES found that although many of the usual suspects affected
        voting behaviour (housing, the economy, etc.), 2020 was the COVID-19
        election. Respondents were asked what they thought was the most
        important issue of the election. The researchers’ word cloud below shows
        COVID-19 was the most mentioned issue.
      </p>
      <img src="/essays/hotelling/images/wordcloud.png" width="500" />
      <blockquote>
        “Moreover, the public overwhelmingly supported the government’s response
        to Covid, with 84% of people approving or strongly approving, while only
        6% disapproved. Of those who approved or strongly approved of the
        response, 57% reported casting a vote for Labour (9% voted Green, 3% New
        Zealand First and 1% Māori Party), while only 19% voted for National.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Through all the COVID noise, it's hard to pick up the signal of any
        substantive change in Labour’s appeal. When measuring party position,
        the main source of data in the literature is the Comparative Manifestos
        Project (CMP). In the CMP data, policy positions are assessed through a
        content analysis of election programs. Coders isolate quasi-sentences in
        a party’s policy program and pair them with policy categories
        (education, defence, law and order, morality, etc.) using
        pre-established common classification scheme consisting of 56
        categories. The proportion of quasi-sententences spent on each category
        provide the basis for estimating the policy priorities of a party.
        However, there are no CMP data available for the 2020 NZ election yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the best evidence that Hotelling’s Law is at play is that,
        despite commanding the most significant parliamentary majority in
        history, this Labour Government has acted with restraint—dare I say,
        they've been conservative, rather than emboldened.
      </p>
      <p>Here's Hooton:</p>
      <blockquote>
        “Jacinda Ardern talks a big game but is from the same mould [as John
        key]. That’s partly because she claims, disingenuously, that “radical
        change takes time” — about which David Lange, Sir Roger Douglas, Ruth
        Richardson and Sir Douglas Graham would disagree.”
      </blockquote>
      <h4>4. Pizza, Reprised</h4>
      <p>
        I glossed over a detail earlier. Pizza Hut and Domino’s sell roughly
        comparable products, but Hell’s offers something different. Hell’s is
        more expensive, leveraging its premium ingredients and gourmet flavour
        combinations. They are targeting a different market segment—not the
        median consumer, but someone who cares about free-range produce, exotic
        tastes, and can afford to spend a bit more.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two ways to get the beach goers to come to your ice-cream
        stand: occupy the centre of the beach, or have better ice-cream—at
        least, more differentiated ice-cream. By encroaching upon the space
        traditionally occupied by National, Labour has abdicated responsibility
        for its historic voter base. Customers who come looking for those
        ice-cream varieties that Labour used to provide are increasingly
        disappointed to discover the only flavour on offer is vanilla.
        Simultaneously, National seems to be regaining their feet. Hooton claims
        that National have performed best when they form a robust coalition
        between their conservative and liberal elements. Luxon’s front bench is
        reminiscent of precisely the Key/English combination for which Hooton is
        nostalgic, reminding voters who turned to Labour for refuge that no one
        serves vanilla like National serves vanilla. The question lingers: once
        the dust settles, what will Labour offer?
