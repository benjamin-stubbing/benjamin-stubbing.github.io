        It is also possible that both are decoys,
        <em>trompe l’oeils</em> intended to disguise the erosion of both books
        and systems. It is no bad thing in any case that between the two our
        bookshelves should serve from time to time as joggers of the memory, as
        cat rests and as lumber rooms."<br /><br />—

        This is where I keep track of other people's reading lists,
        recommendations, and that special category of aphorisms and witticims
        dedicated to the curation of reading and the curation of libraries.

      <h3>My reading</h3>
      <p>
        Last year, at the suggestion of a friend, I started keeping track of my
        reading with a

      <h3>Aphorisms</h3>
      <p>
        A lot of great things have been said about books, how best to read, and
        the curation of one's (anti-)library. Here are some of my favourites:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Some people love books reverently—my great-aunt, for instance, a
        librarian and a passionate reader who declined to open any volume beyond
        a hundred-degree angle, so tenderly did she treat their spines. My
        father, by contrast, loved books ravenously. His always had a devoured
        look to them: scribbled on, folded over, cracked down the middle,
        liberally stained with coffee, Scotch, pistachio dust, and bits of the
        brightly colored shells of peanut M&Ms."*
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        *I used to be precious with my books, never opening them too much or
        scribbling in the margins. Once finished and returned to the shelf, you
        would be forgiven for thinking a book had never been touched in the
        first place. Now the complete opposite is true. I am a messy reader. I
        have grown to forgive myself for this devolution thanks to the words of
        Kathryn Schulz.
      </p>
      <h4>Carl Sagan</h4>
      <blockquote>
        “What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a
        tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark
        squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another
        person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the
        millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head,
        directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions,
        binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant
        epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans
        are capable of working magic.”
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Schopenhaur</h4>
      <blockquote>
        “In order to read what is good one must make it a condition never to
        read what is bad for life is short, and both time and strength is
        limited.”
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Rebecca Solnit</h4>
      <blockquote>
        “The object we call a book is not the real book, but its potential, like
        a musical score or seed. It exists fully only in the act of being read;
        and its real home is inside the head of the reader, where the symphony
        resounds, the seed germinates. A book is a heart that only beats in the
        chest of another."
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Kafka</h4>
      <blockquote>
        "I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us.
        If the book we’re reading doesn’t wake us up with a blow on the head,
        what are we reading it for? So that it will make us happy, as you write?
        Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind
        of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we
        had to. But we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that
        grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than
        ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a
        suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us. That is my
        belief"
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Clive James</h4>
      <blockquote>
        "If you don't know the exact moment when the lights will go out, you
        might as well read until they do."
