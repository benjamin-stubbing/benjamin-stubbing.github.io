      <blockquote>
        'So I guarantee you nothing for certain, except my making known what
        point I have so far reached in my knowledge of it. Do not linger over
        the matter but over my fashioning of it. Where my borrowings are
        concerned, see whether I have been able to select something which
        improves my theme: I get others to say what I cannot put so well myself,
        sometimes because of the weakness of my language and sometimes because
        of the weakness of my intellect . . . Myself, who am constantly unable
        to sort out my borrowings by my knowledge of where they came from, am
        quite able to measure my reach and to know that my own soil is in no
        wise capable of bringing forth some of the richer flowers that I find
        rooted there and which all the produce of my own growing could never
        match.'<br /><br />—Montaigne
