      <h2>The Kissing Booth & the Necessity of Unhappy Endings</h2>
      <p>
        For the uninitiated, here is my summary of
        <em>The Kissing Booth</em> trilogy:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >High-school falls in love with her best friend’s brother. Teen-drama
          and Netflix-comedy ensue.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        My problem with <em>The Kissing Booth 3</em> is the ending. Realising
        that all her young-adult life she had thought only of what her
        boyfriend, Noah, and best friend, Lee, had wanted, Elle finally decides
        to put herself first. She decides to go her own way, leaving her friends
        to go theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        What <em>The Kissing Booth 3</em> does well is to capture how important
        it feels for teenagers to have proximity to their friends. Physical
        distance, although not an insurmountable barrier thanks to social media,
        represents an irreparable schism not just between friends but between
        things as they are and things as they will be. ‘The Kissing Booth’ uses
        melodrama and ham-acting to invoke in the viewer a sense of the calamity
        that the end of high school once represented for many.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the illusion is broken when, at the very end of the film,
        we cut to a “5 years later” epilogue that shows the whole gang reunited
        and, importantly, hints that Noah and Elle rekindle their romance. My
        qualm with the epilogue is that, hitherto, the movie does a good job of
        assuring the viewer that it is not uncommon to view the end of high
        school as the crossroads of destiny—it is nothing to be embarrassed
        by—but that it doesn’t really matter in the scheme of things. The
        Kissing Booth 3 also almost does a good job of showing how one ought to
        leave people well—without callous indifference on the one hand, and
        without platitudes of “until we see again” on the other... that is,
        until the epilogue showed that Noah and Elle could find each other
        again. That, although they had grown, they had never grown apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tropes of the genre are suitably adhered to, but at a cost. For a
        tantalising moment, there was a possibility that the film would just end
        without having a coda on the romantic plot line. To not include the
        epilogue may feel like too abrupt an ending to have been tenable, akin
        to stopping the music in the middle of a bar. But really, the music
        could have finished the phrase without having to reprise the motif.
      </p>
      <h3>The Humanities as Education</h3>
      <p>
        Alain de Botton posits that the humanities—literature, art, music,
        drama, Netflix teen rom-coms— should help us to live. De Botton says
        that "we should look to culture as a repository of consoling ideas about
        how to face our most pressing personal and professional issues. We
        should look to novels and historical narratives to impart moral
        instruction and edification; to great paintings for suggestions about
        values; to philosophy to probe our anxieties and offer consolations."
        The humanities offer these therapeutic and illuminative aspects,
        allowing us to emerge from their study as slightly less selfish and
        blinkered human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children’s stories, in the broadest sense of the term, need more unhappy
        endings. It is uncontroversial to say that in these formative years, it
        is important to gently expose children to the wider world. Just as a
        parent may allow their child a sip of wine at dinner or to earn pocket
        money by doing chores, we should gently expose young people to grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two, understandable, reasons why we have given into the
        temptation to provide children with purely entertaining stories that are
        too clothed in safety to be genuinely illuminating about loss. First,
        themes of loss and grief feel too dark to belong in children’s stories.
        But this is a disservice to authors and illustrators of children’s
        stories, whose very genius is to encode in whimsical rhymes and
        transfixing colours and shapes a toolkit for exploring almost all other
        aspects of what it is to be a little human. They can handle grief too.
        Also, I am not proselytizing that parents must read their children more
        stories with unhappy endings or make them watch more sad films. Rather,
        there should be more options with unhappy endings available, so that a
        parent has these at hand to supplement their own guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, it is tempting to view loss and grief as a rude interruption
        into our otherwise ordinary lives. This is a mistake. You need not go so
        far as to embrace the Buddhist mantra that life is suffering to realise
        the inevitability of experiencing emotional turmoil and agony at some
        point in our lives. Indeed, the periods in our lives where we—or someone
        we love—is not going through hardship are the rare periods. And yet,
        despite claiming that we want children’s stories to gently introduce
        them to the wide world, we are woefully negligent of our responsibility
        to provide stories that may help prepare children to deal with
        adversity.
      </p>
      <h3>It’s Not Your Funeral</h3>
      <p>
        Before going overseas for a holiday, you might do some background
        reading to prime yourself and enhance the pleasure of anticipation. You
        might plan where you want to go, what activities you want to do, and
        take note of what tourist-traps to avoid. Analogously, as children
        commence the journey that is life, a little background reading can help
        them to navigate grief and avoid its pitfalls.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can feel clumsy and awkward to bring children along to a funeral,
        even more so than bringing a baby on a plane. But as a society, we seem
        to recognise how essential it is to children to the funerals of
        estranged cousins because children are—although it feels harsh to
        admit—suitably removed from the loss to not be overcome with grief while
        still recognising the grief in people they know. Going to a funeral as a
        child provides vital instruction on how to handle grief. For precisely
        the same reasons that we take children to the funerals of our estranged
        cousins, there ought to be more children’s stories with unhappy endings.
        Children’s stories with unhappy endings present a gentler introduction
        to grief than a real funeral, simulating personal unhappiness and
        offering children insights into how to deal with emotions.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Disney’s <em>Inside Out</em> was a wonderful illustration of how
        children’s movies could serve a therapeutic role, educating children
        about how humans experience emotions such as grief. We don’t need more
        <em>Inside Out</em>s. We need stories about how Little Red Riding Hood
        processed the murder of her grandmother. We need stories about how
        Cinderella moved on after Prince Charming failed to track her down. We
        need stories about how, at the end of high school, we do not need to
        take comfort in the false sense of security that we will be reunited
        with the people we love. Letting people go while simultaneously
        believing you will end up back together is not letting them go; it is
        cruel. And it is a cruel thing for The Kissing Booth 3 to propagate. The
        <em>The Kissing Booth 3</em>
        squandered an opportunity to console teenagers, on the cusp of entering
        “the real world”, that friends come and go and grow apart—and that’s
        okay. And that you can leave a romantic partner in a healthy way,
        without secretly harbouring the belief that you are soulmates.
