      <p><b>Benjamin Stubbing</b></p>

      <p>
        I was born at a very young age in Auckland, New Zealand. On my mums side
        I whakapapa to Ko Te Rarawa and Ngai Takoto and on my dad’s side I
        whakapapa to Ngati Awa-nui-a-Rangi and King Country Tainu.
      </p>
      <p>
        I live in Wellington where I work for The Treasury. I provide research
        and analysis to support social investment, Treasury priorities, and
        insights into potential tax or welfare system changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I’ve worked as a management consultant for PwC and as a
        research assistant at Victoria University, the Human Rights Measurement
        Initiative (HRMI), and the Ministry of Education.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m interested in improving welfare, identifying places where bad rules
        impede the common good, and making the world—and our corner of it here
        in Aotearoa—a great place to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        To let off steam, I participate in full-contact Origami and I play
        tennis. I dabble in classical guitar and from time to time I reprise my
        violin-playing after a fashion. On occasion I’ve been known to act and
        emcee.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find it even more awkward and contrived to introduce ones website than
        it is to introduce oneself, so here's Montaigne to say what I can't:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        'I do not doubt that I often happen to talk of things which are treated
        better in the writings of master-craftsmen, and with more authenticity.
        What you have here is purely an assay of my natural, not at all of my
        acquired, abilities. Anyone who catches me out in ignorance does me no
        harm: I cannot vouch to other people for my reasonings: I can scarcely
        vouch for them to myself and am by no means satisfied with them. If
        anyone is looking for knowledge let him go where such fish are to be
        caught: there is nothing I lay claim to less.'
      </blockquote>
