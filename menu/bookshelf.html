        This is where I keep track of other people's reading lists,
        recommendations, and that special category of aphorisms and witticims
        dedicated to reading and the curation of libraries.

      <h3>My reading</h3>
      <p>
        Last year, at the suggestion of a friend, I started keeping track of my
        reading with a
        <a

      <h3>Aphorisms</h3>
      <p>
        A lot of great things have been said about books, how best to read, and
        the curation of one's (anti-)library. Here are some of my favourites:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        'Some people love books reverently—my great-aunt, for instance, a
        librarian and a passionate reader who declined to open any volume beyond
        a hundred-degree angle, so tenderly did she treat their spines. My
        father, by contrast, loved books ravenously. His always had a devoured
        look to them: scribbled on, folded over, cracked down the middle,
        liberally stained with coffee, Scotch, pistachio dust, and bits of the
        brightly colored shells of peanut M&Ms.'*
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        *I used to be precious with my books, never opening them too much or
        scribbling in the margins. Once finished and returned to the shelf, you
        would be forgiven for thinking a book had never been touched in the
        first place. Now the complete opposite is true. I am a messy reader. I
        have grown to forgive myself for this devolution thanks to the words of
        Kathryn Schulz.
      </p>
      <h4>Carl Sagan</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a
        tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark
        squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another
        person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the
        millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head,
        directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions,
        binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant
        epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans
        are capable of working magic.'
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Schopenhauer</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'In order to read what is good one must make it a condition never to
        read what is bad for life is short, and both time and strength is
        limited.'
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        Writers can be divided into meteors, planets and fixed stars. The first
        produce a momentary effect: you gaze up,cry: "Look!"—and then they
        vanish forever. The second, the moving stars, endure for much longer. BY
        virtue of their proximity they often shine more brightly than the fixed
        stars, which the ignorant mistake them for. But they too must soon
        vacate their place, they shine moreover only with a borrowed light, and
        their sphere of influence is limited to their own fellow travellers
        (their contemporaries). The third alone are unchanging, standing firm in
        the firmament, shine by their own light and influence all ages equally,
        in that their aspect does not alter when our ppoint of view alters since
        they have no parallax. Unlike the others, they do not belong to one
        system (nation) alone: they belong to the Universe. But it is precisely
        because they are so high that their light usually takes so many years to
        reach the eyes of dwellers on Earth.
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Francis Bacon</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'Some books should be tasted, some devoured, but only a few should be
        chewed and digested thoroughly.'
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Umberto Eco</h4>
      <blockquote>
        ‘It could be said that they are still people who consider a bookshelf as
        a mere storage place for already-read books and do not think of the
        library as a working tool. But there is more to it than that. I believe
        that, confronted by a vast array of books, anyone will be seized by the
        anguish of learning, and will inevitably lapse into asking the question
        that expresses his torment and his remorse.’
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        On how best to answer when someone asks, “What a lot of books! Have you
        read them all?”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        ‘The best answer is the one always used by Roberto Leydig: “And more,
        dear sir, many more,” which freezes the adversary and plunges him into a
        state of awed admiration. But I find it merciless and angst-generating.
        Now I have fallen back on the riposte: “No, these are the ones I have to
        read by the end of the month. I keep the others in my office,” a reply
        that on the one hand suggests a sublime ergonomic strategy, and on the
        other leads the visitor to hasten the moment of his departure.’
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</h4>
      <blockquote>
        ‘The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your
        financial means . . . allow you to put there. You will accumulate more
        knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of
        unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the
        more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this
        collection of unread books an antilibrary.’
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Rebecca Solnit</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'The object we call a book is not the real book, but its potential, like
        a musical score or seed. It exists fully only in the act of being read;
        and its real home is inside the head of the reader, where the symphony
        resounds, the seed germinates. A book is a heart that only beats in the
        chest of another.'
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Kafka</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us.
        If the book we’re reading doesn’t wake us up with a blow on the head,
        what are we reading it for? So that it will make us happy, as you write?
        Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind
        of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we
        had to. But we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that
        grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than
        ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a
        suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us. That is my
        belief.'
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Chritopher Waltz</h4>
      <p>
        Although he was talking about comedy, I think the same applies to books.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        'Comedy is like a cigar; it has to be <em>exquisite</em> to be any
        good.'
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Kierkegaard</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'What then is education? I had thought it was the curriculum the
        individual ran through in order to catch up with himself, and anyone who
        does not want to go through this curriculum will be little helped by
        being born into the most enlightened age.'
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Clive James</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'If you don't know the exact moment when the lights will go out, you
        might as well read until they do.'
