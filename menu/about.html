      <p><b>Benjamin Stubbing</b></p>

      <p>
        Born at a very young age in Auckland, New Zealand, nowadays you’ll find me in Wellington where I work for the Treasury in the Analytics and Insights team. A&I undertake research and analysis on social and economic issues, looking for new and better ways for the public service to improve outcomes for New Zealanders.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m enthusiastic about creating a future of abundance: building a materially healthy society that nourishes welfare, ameliorating  places where bad rules impede the common good, and growing the things that make a nation great and the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm curious about almost everything! See my Bookshelf and Writing, e.g. <a href="https://cream-lift-9ad.notion.site/The-Coolest-Things-I-Learned-in-2023-in-no-particular-order-2a5037b248874bf9be979c791ed9636d?pvs=4"

        <li>Ko te rarawa, ko ngai takoto, ko Ngati-Awa-Nui-a-Rangi aku iwi. Kei Pōneke ahau e noho ana. Kei Tamaki Makaurau taku kāinga.</li>
        <li>Previously I’ve worked as a management consultant for PwC and as a research assistant at Victoria University, the Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI), and the Ministry of Education.</li>
        <li>To let off steam, I regularly have it handed to me in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ID5S6-dgE_8IMrOYkialkyaR6BGr1dDcQqNYaJJuydQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-contact Origami</a> and I play
        tennis with mildly more success. I dabble in violin and guitar after a fashion and on occasion I’ve been known to act and
        emcee.</li>
        <li>I studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Victoria University of Wellington, focusing on econometrics, quantitative comparative politics, and symbolic systems.</li>
        <li>On weekends, I circulate an old-school <a href="https://benjaminstubbing.substack.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">links blast</a> and I read <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KL3Ung7reIdBaDlK3LkV5zmfuP8y-q6zHt0PIKVGFBw/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very slowly</a>.</li>
