      <p>Kia ora! I'm Benjamin.</p>
      <p>
        I work for PwC in Wellington, where I'm part of both the strategy and
        finance & economics teams.
      </p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        I'm originally from Auckland. My parents are from Whangarei. On my mum's
        side I whakapapa to Te Rarawa and Ngai Takoto in Northland, and on my
        dad's side I whakapapa to Ngāti Pūkeko in Whakatani and Tainui in King
        Country.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I enjoy tennis and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I play violin
        and classical guitar after a fashion, and on occasion I've been known to
        act and M.C.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I studied philosophy, politics, economics and econometrics at
        Victoria University of Wellington.
      </p>
      <h3>What motivates me?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about improving welfare. I’m sympathetic to effective
        altruism (EA)—roughly, the use of evidence and careful analysis to
        figure out the best ways of making the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>Some interests of mine are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Improving the quality of institutional decision-making under
          uncertainty
        </li>
        <li>
          Getting public- and private-sector actors to think about the long term
          future
        </li>
        <li>Defending human rights</li>
        <li>Protecting the natural environment</li>
        <li>
          Using data science, neural networks, and cognitive technologies to
          improve policy and project management
        </li>
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Boosting the rate of sustainable economic growth</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Improving decision-making</h3>
      <p>
        I’m interested in improving the quality of institutional
        decision-making, especially decision-making under radical uncertainty.
        Improving decision-making requires vast improvements in management.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        'The Oxford Handbook on Megaprojects points out that it is possible to
        quantify lessons from the failures of projects like high speed rail
        projects because almost all fail so there is a large enough sample to
        make statistical comparisons, whereas there can be no statistical
        analysis of successes because they are so rare. It is extremely
        interesting that the lessons of Manhattan (1940s), ICBMs (1950s) and
        Apollo (1960s) remain absolutely cutting edge because it is so hard to
        apply them and almost nobody has managed to do it. The Pentagon
        systematically de-programmed itself from more effective approaches to
        less effective approaches from the mid-1960s, in the name of
        ‘efficiency’. Is this just another way of saying that people like
        General Groves and George Mueller are rarer than Fields Medallists?'<br /><br />—
