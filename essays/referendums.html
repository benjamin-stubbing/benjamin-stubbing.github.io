      <h2>Against Referendums</h2>
      <p>
        <em>This was written in July 2020, prior to the November 2020 general
        election and referendum.</em></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        When New Zealanders vote in this year’s general election, we will also
        participate in a world-leading double referendum. One referendum
        question will ask about the legalisation of cannabis for recreational
        use, and the other will ask whether euthanasia should be legalised in
        certain circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there is ample debate surrounding the content of these bills,
        little has been said about whether a referendum is the right way to make
        these political decisions. One of the few voices on the issue has been
        Dr Bryce Edwards, a senior associate at the Institute for Governance and
        Policy Studies at Victoria University in Wellington.
      </p>
      <p>Edwards says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        “Referendums should be celebrated for resolving difficult and divisive
        issues, as well as for their ability to draw the public into political
        decision-making and debate. Putting questions to the public means that a
        much bigger societal debate occurs, and ultimately the decisions made
        have greater legitimately [sic] and endurance.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Are referendums the best way to resolve political issues? Are they, as Edwards says, "even more legitimate than typical parliamentary process"?
      </p>
      <h3>What is the role of politics?</h3>
      <p>
        The role of politics is not merely to legislate and distribute
        resources. If it were, we could defer to experts. Politics exists to
        reconcile the conflicting desires and aspirations of people within a
        polity, and to do so without violence through reasoned and respectful
        debate.
      </p>
      <p>
        A political resolution, then, is not merely formal decisions on a course
        of action. The role of a political resolution is, more fundamentally,
        the reconciliation of diverging or opposing views. This is something a
        referendum does not achieve, yet it is essential to the maintenance of a
        well-functioning democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a democracy, differences of opinion are overcome by a common
        acceptance of the legitimacy of its decision-making processes—not
        necessarily of the decisions themselves but of the method of making
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Former UK Supreme Court Justice, Jonathan Sumption, has said that although majority-rule is the
        basic principle of democracy, this only means that a majority suffices
        to authorise the State’s acts:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        'It is not enough to make them legitimate, because majority-rule is no
        more than a rule of decision. It does nothing to accommodate our
        differences; it simply restates them in numerical terms. A legitimate
        democracy cannot operate on the basis that a bare majority takes one
        hundred percent of the political spoils, without any regard for the
        minority. If it did, it would harbour large and permanently disaffected
        groups in its midst who had no common bonds to transcend their
        differences with the majority.’
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If the majority can do whatever it wants, without regard for the
        minority, then the ethic of reciprocity—the basis of legitimate
        democratic government—is threatened. That is why all democracies have
        evolved methods of diluting the power of majorities. One such method is
        representative politics.
      </p>
      <h3>The General Good</h3>
      <p>
        Today we could, in theory, abolish representative politics. For the
        first time since the whole citizenry of ancient Athens gathered in the
        Agora to transact public business, it would be technically feasible for
        the electorate to vote directly on every measure. In fact, no democracy
        works like that. They act through elected legislatures. They do this not
        only for reasons of practicality, but also on principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        In one of his contributions to the federalist papers, James Madison gave
        what is still the classic justification for representative politics: A
        chosen body of citizens is less likely to sacrifice the true interests
        of the country to short-term considerations, unthinking impulses or
        sectional interests. “Under such a regulation”, he wrote, “it may well
        happen that the public voice pronounced by the representatives of the
        people will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by
        the people themselves.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In England, Madison’s contemporary, the politician and philosopher
        Edmund Burke, carried this idea further. 'Parliament,' he said, 'is not
        a congress of ambassadors. . . Parliament is a deliberative assembly of
        one nation with one interest—that of the whole: where, not local
        purposes, not local prejudices ought to guide, but the general good
        resulting from the general reason of the whole.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Members of parliament were there to represent the national interest and
        not the opinions of their constituents. This view might be called
        elitist, but political elites have their uses. Professional politicians
        should be expected to bring to their work a more reflective approach, a
        broader outlook, and a lot more information than their electors. There
        is a further point. Nations have collective interests which extend over
        a longer time scale and a wider geographical range than are ever likely
        to be reflected in the public opinion of the moment. Today, for example,
        we face issues such as climate change, on which the interests of future
        generations differ radically from those of the current electorate. In
        the 18th century, David Hume pointed out what he called the incurable
        narrowness of soul that makes people prefer the immediate to the remote.
        If we are to avoid the same narrowness of soul, we must take a view of
        the national interest which transcends snapshots of the current state of
        electoral opinion.
      </p>
      <h3>The Pitfalls of Referendums</h3>
      <p>
        A referendum is a device for bypassing the representative political
        process. It takes decision-making out of the hands of politicians, whose
        interest is generally to accommodate the widest possible range of
        opinion, and places it in the hands of individual electors who have no
        reason to consider anything but their own opinion. Consequently, a
        referendum not only inhibits an independent assessment of the national
        interest by professional politicians, but also promotes narrowness and
        personalisation of decisions which have implications beyond the
        individuals whose opinion decides them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an age of increasing suspicion of elites, as well as a growing public
        discontent with democracy, some have called for more devolution of power
        to voters on key issues. However, an important object of modern
        democratic constitutions is to treat the people as a source of
        legitimacy while placing barriers between them and the direct operation
        of the levers of power. This is done to contain the fissiparous
        tendencies of democracy—to counter the inherent tendency of democracy to
        destroy itself when majorities become a source of instability and
        oppression.
