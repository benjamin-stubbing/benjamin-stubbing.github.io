        'You should have this thought ready in hand against any eventuality: 'I
        have seen this before.' Generally whenever you look you will find the
        same things. The histories—ancient, more recent, and modern—are full of
        them: cities and households are full of them today. There is nothing
        new. All is familiar and all short lived.'<br /><br />—Marcus Aurelius,

        'Look back over the past—all those many changes of dynasties. And you
        can forsee the future too: it will be completely alike, incapable of
        devitiating from the rhythm of the present.'<br /><br />—Marcus

        While seconded to Christchurch, I haven’t devoted my typically excessive
        amount of cognitive surplus to reading the news. Yet I haven’t missed
        anything and I’ve enjoyed myself. Reflecting on this, I realise—as I
        seasonally do—I should read less news.

        The Lindy Effect is one way of thinking about why some things endure.
        The Lindy Effect says that the future life expectancy of some
        non-perishable things, like technology or ideas, is proportional to
        their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a
        longer remaining life expectancy. Where the Lindy Effect applies,
        mortality rate decreases with time.

        <em>Macbeth</em> was written around 1606 but its popularity endures.
        Periodically, some self-described educational specialist makes a case
        for the revival of Shakespeare, but Shakespeare doesn’t need
        rejuvenation or defence. <em>Macbeth</em> has endured because there is
        something in it that is resilient to changes in fashion.

        News is not Lindy by definition. It doesn’t last and, what’s more, it
        doesn’t generate value unless your value-add is to know the news. It’s
        like day trading, which is a sub-optimal strategy for value creation
        unless it's your vocation and you have access to the fastest internet
        and private offerings. Day trading is fine if it’s your job to day
        trade. Similarly, if you’re a professional policy wonk you should know
        the latest policy news.

        If the goal, however, is to create value (for personal pleasure or
        professional diligence) by separating the signal from the noise, then we
        must take a wider view. The noisiness of political news is well
        illustrated by

        Political news is inherently fuzzy and genuine changes are occasional.
        If you’re too focused on a single tree, you won’t see the forest.

        As well as being noisy, a lot of news (read: punditry) is reliably
        misleading. Philip Tetlock’s research has demonstrated that “expert”
        predictions are often less accurate than monkeys throwing darts at a
        board. For a great contemporary example of the abysmal track record of
        pundits, Jerusalem Demsas has done a wonderful

        When I return to reading the news, I'm going to adopt a sort of
        dollar-cost averaging approach. In financial investing, dollar cost
        averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount at
        fixed intervals—say, 10% of your pay check every month. By doing this,
        you buy more when the market is down (the cost of assets is lower) and
        less when the market is up (the cost of assets is higher). Similarly,
        when reading the news, I’ll limit the amount of investment (time) I
        place in reading news. Busy news days are like busy trading days: it is
        the habbit of the market to ovevalue stocks which have shown excellent
        growth or are glamorous for some other reason. We can expect the market
        to undervalue what isn't fashionable. So, we should drop what is
        fashionable and instead read what is timeless to find value that is
        untemporamental.
