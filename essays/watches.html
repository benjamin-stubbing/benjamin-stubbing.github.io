      <h2>Watches, Human Unexceptionalism & the Future of Work</h2>
      <p>
        On Christmas day, 1969, Seiko introduced the Astron—the world’s first
        quartz wristwatch. It was a limited edition of 100 gold-cased watches,
        priced at 450,000 yen, equivalent then to the cost of a Toyota Corolla.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the significance of the Astron, you need to understand the
        difference between mechanical watches and quartz watches. Quartz watches
        tick. Inside a quartz watch, the battery sends electricity to the quartz
        crystal, making it oscillate at a precise frequency. A quartz crystal
        typically oscillates at 32,768 Hz. A circuit counts the number of
        oscillations and uses them to generate regular electric impulses—one per
        second. These impulses can either power an LCD display or they can drive
        a small electric motor, turning gear wheels that spin the second,
        minute, and hour hands. Hence, the tick.
      </p>
      <p>
        As opposed to using electricity to measure the passage of time,
        mechanical watches use, well, a mechanical mechanism. A mechanical watch
        is driven by a spring. The force of the spring is transmitted through a
        series of gears powering the balance wheel—a weighted wheel that
        oscillates back and forth at a constant (to some extent) rate. A device
        called the escapement releases the watch’s wheels, letting them move
        forward a small amount with each swing of the balance wheel, giving the
        seconds hand an appearance of sweeping across the dial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mechanical watches are less accurate than their quartz counterparts.
        Consequently, quartz technology wreaked havoc on the watch industry. The
        Astron catalysed what horologists refer to as the Quartz Crisis. By
        1985, watch industry employment had fallen to 32,000 from 89,450 in
        1970. Between 1974 and 1983, Swiss watch production fell from a record
        96 million units to 45 million.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clearest sign of the pervasive impact of quartz technology on the
        watch industry, Joe Thomson notes, is the number of quartz watches
        produced each year. In 2015, according to the Japan Watch & Clock
        Association, 1.46 billion watches were produced. Of those, 1.42 billion
        were quartz, 97% of the total.
      </p>
      <p>
        By all accounts, quartz technology should have killed the mechanical
        watch completely. Quartz watches are cheaper to make than mechanical
        watches and are more precise to boot. Yet mechanical watches persist and
        thrive. It is tempting to attribute the continued relevance of
        mechanical watches to brand equity alone. To be sure, marketing has done
        wonders to position certain watch brands in a category of
        “something-you-buy-when-you-make-the-big-time.” This is perhaps best
        exemplified in hip-hop music. But although brand equity is certainly an
        asset today, at the outset of the Quarz Crisis, brand equity was not
        enough to reverse the tides of change. Even big-name brands, such as
        Patek Philippe and Rolex, felt the need to make quartz watches of their
        own.
      </p>
      <p>
        How did mechanical watches reinvent themselves? In 1974 the longest
        continuously running watch company in the world, Blancpain, released a
        series of hand-made, mechanical watches under the slogan: “Since 1735
        there has never been a quartz Blancpain watch. And there never will be.”
        At face value this may strike the reader as the very brand equity I
        previously called inconsequential. However, Blancpain’s marketing
        leveraged more than simply its name (actually, Blancpain’s name hadn’t
        been used in years); Blancpain leveraged the superiority of mechanical
        watches over quartz watches, when there was no such superiority to speak
        of.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many theses attempting to explain how the watch industry
        “luxurified” and I do not mean to undermine them. I suggest to you that
        we should also consider the sociological factors that lead to increased
        demand for mechanical watches when they were on the brink of extinction.
        Blancpain’s reinvention incited a wider revolution in mechanical
        watches, leading them to be embraced once again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the reinvention of mechanical watches illustrates something
        interesting about what it means to be human in the digital economy. The
        current consensus among so-called futurists is that if a robot can do a
        human’s job at a lower cost, then the human will be replaced. And yet,
        the watch industry seems to show that the market values human
        “unexceptionalism” more than we currently give it credit for. The
        reinvention of mechanical watches indicates that—in some cases—customers
        are willing to pay more for human craftsmanship, in all its
        imperfections.

        Aurel Bacs, a legendary watch auctioneer, had this to say regarding the
        ever-growing vintage watch industry: “Certainly, vintage watches have
        immensely increased in popularity over the last few years. I think it
        has something to do with the way our society evolves; everything becomes
        more and more perfect. I mean, look at my mobile phone here on the desk.
        It looks exactly like yours... I cannot tell you a story about it. And
        when it’s broken, we throw it. Vintage watches bring us back to times
        that we miss—times when things maybe weren’t perfect... but done with
        love.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps as jobs are automated we will come to miss some of the human
        imperfections we currently strive to eradicate.
