      <blockquote>
        'I do not doubt that I often happen to talk of things which are treated
        better in the writings of master-craftsmen, and with more authenticity.
        What you have here is purely an assay of my natural, not at all of my
        acquired, abilties. Anyone who catches me out in ignorance does me no
        harm: I cannot vouch to other people for my reasonings: I can scarcely
        vouch for them to myself and am by no means satisfied with them. If
        anyone is looking for knowledge let him go where such fish are to be
        caught: there is nothing I lay claim to less.'<br /><br />—Montaigne
