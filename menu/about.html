      <p>
        I live in Wellington, New Zealand, and I work as a consultant. I'm
        originally from Auckland. My parents are from Whangarei. On my mum's
        side I whakapapa to Te Rarawa and Ngai Takoto in Northland, and on my
        dad's side I whakapapa to Ngāti Pūkeko in Whakatane and Tainui in King
        Country.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I enjoy tennis and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu*. I play violin
        and classical guitar after a fashion, and on occasion I've been known to
        act and M.C.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I studied philosophy, politics, economics and econometrics at
        Victoria University of Wellington.
      </p>
      <h3>What motivates me?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about improving welfare. I’m sympathetic to effective
        altruism (EA)—roughly, the use of evidence and careful analysis to
        figure out the best ways of making the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>Some interests of mine are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Improving the quality of institutional decision-making under
          uncertainty
        </li>
        <li>
          Getting public- and private-sector actors to think about the long term
          future
        </li>
        <li>Defending human rights</li>
        <li>Protecting the natural environment</li>
        <li>
          Using data science, neural networks, and cognitive technologies to
          improve policy and project management
        </li>
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Boosting the rate of sustainable economic growth</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        *I used to say "I recently picked up BJJ." But my friend Oliver pointed
        out this is no longer true; the truth is, I'm just shit.
