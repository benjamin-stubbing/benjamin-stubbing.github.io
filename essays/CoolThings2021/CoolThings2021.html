      <h1>Coolest Things I learned in 2021 (in no particular order)</h1>
      <h2>1. Google Scholar notifications</h2>
      <p>
        When you follow someone on Google Scholar, you get emailed every time
        they publish a new article.

      <h2>2. Roger Federer is still the GOAT*</h2>
      <p>
        Jim Pagels was sports and data journalist turned Economics PhD student
        who tragically died in a car collision this year. He did some 
        <a href="https://jimpagels.weebly.com/publications.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1">hilarious and interesting work</span></a>
        on everything from tennis and taxes to Mad Men and
        Trump. As a Federer tragic, I especially liked his

        for
        ranking the best tennis players of all time. One of my projects for this
        summer is to apply it to more recent data.

      <h2>4. Brazilian Jiu Jtsu & First Principles</h2>
      <p>
        After reading <a href="https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-pleasures-of-drowning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this essay by Sam Harris</a>, I was drawn to BJJ by the depths of the strategy required to do it well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s a definition of BJJ from John Danaher—a Kiwi, and former NYU Philosophy PhD student <em>cum</em> world class BJJ coach with a knack for training some of the deadliest people on Earth:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Jiu-Jitsu is an art and science which looks to use a combination of tactical and mechanical advantage to focus a very high percentage of my strength against a very low percentage of my opponents strength at a critical point on their body such that were I to exert my strength upon that critical point they could no longer continue to fight."
      </blockquote>
    <h2>
      5. Anna Karenina
    </h2>
    <p>
      I read this while I was locked down in Auckland for 6 weeks.
    </p>  
    <p>
      It was always going to be a good read. What I didn’t expect is how I continue to see ideas and characters from the novel in my day to day life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      While living in Wellington and working for the government, I’ve met a few Oblonsky-esque bureaucrats. Similarly, when I have–what seems to me–a great idea, I am pained–as Levin is–to realise my revelation is already slipping through the gaps of my mind. Euphoria and the sublime pass, and our moment of revelation is gone. We have to remind ourselves of how it felt. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Karenina is possibly the best fiction I’ve ever read. It was a slog at times, but it was well worth the struggle.
    </p>
    <h2>
      6. “I wasted my undergraduate education studying”
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was a diligent student. Before this year, Going Out on The Town held no appeal. 
      But to cut through the malaise that accompanies a breakup, one begins to think: 
      "fuck it! Why not?"
    </p>
    <img src="/essays/CoolThings2021/6. pareto.png" width="500">
    <p>
      If I could offer my younger self some advice, I'd tell him that returns 
      to time spent studying diminish rapidly at the margin. And I suspect progress on 
      assignments follows a power distribution, meaning most of the work is done in 
      a small portion of the time you spend on it. Practically, this means I should
      have spent a little less time in the library and a little more time at Library.

      7. Treat uni like a 9-to-5
    </h2>
    <p>
      A corollary to not wasting your time at university on studying: treat university like a job. 
    </p>
    <p>
    It is tempting to take it easy and stroll through your days at university. Sleep in. 
    Catch a later bus. Do the readings later, see your friends now. Resist that impulse. 
    Recall Parkinson’s Law: work expands to fill the time available to complete it. 
    If you set strict boundaries around when you work, you will work more efficiently—plus 
    you’ll sleep better.
