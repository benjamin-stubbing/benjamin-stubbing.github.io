      <h2>Globalisation & Inequality</h2>
      <p>

      <p>
        The rise of globalisation has been accompanied by a debate over whether
        it comes at the cost of growing inequality. Globalisation is
        increasingly linked to inequality but often with divergent and polarized
        results. Critics of globalisation argue it exacerbates inequality both
        between and within countries. Others argue that globalisation has closed
        the inequality gap by lifting millions out of poverty. I define
        globalisation and inequality, how they are measured, and review the
        extant literature on globalisation and inequality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Globalisation can be defined as four interrelated structural shifts that
        roughly occurred since the 1980s.[1] First, the internationalisation of
        markets and subsequent decline in the importance of borders including
        changes in laws, institutions, or practices that make various
        transactions easier or less expensive across borders. The growth of
        international regulatory institutions and political agreements to
        facilitate capital flows have liberalised and internationalised
        financial markets, resulting in more financial openness. Second, the
        toughening of tax competition that is often accompanied by neoliberal
        tendencies. The mobility of labour and capital is the antecedent to
        competition. Central neoliberal measures to enhance competition include
        deregulation, liberalisation, and privatisation. Third, the rising
        worldwide interconnectedness through Information and Communication
        Technologies have accelerated the liberalisation of financial
        transactions and communication. Fourth, there is increasing relevance
        and volatility of markets.

        What is inequality? Classic sociological approaches to inequality
        characterise it as a multidimensional construct based not only on
        economic status, but also social and cultural domains.[2] However,
        studies that expand upon economic inequality are rare, so I will narrow
        the scope of my research to economic inequality.[3] Economic inequality
        is the unequal distribution of income or wealth in society. Income
        refers to money received by a household over some period, including
        wages, salaries, and government payments. Wealth refers to the stock of
        assets held by a household. In some ways, wealth is more important for
        understanding economic inequality because wealth generates income, so
        income inequality in part depends on wealth inequality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most studies of economic inequality use the Gini Index.[4] The Gini
        Index is a number that varies between 0, when everyone has the same as
        everyone else, and 1, when one person has everything and everyone else
        has nothing. Although the Gini Index is widely applied, some
        methodological issues make it difficult to interpret when comparing
        different countries. The central difficulty is whether the Gini
        Coefficient is calculated using household-consumption data or
        income-survey data. Income-survey data includes wages, self-employment
        income, income from assets, income from production for households’ own
        consumption, social transfers, and income deductions such as direct
        taxes. Consumption data covers money spent on finished goods and
        services. Both data sources have limitations: different states use
        different techniques to measure consumption data and incomes of the very
        poor and the very rich are underreported in income surveys.[5]
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the actual measure, there is also a question of whether
        inequality is studied as the unequal distribution of income within or
        between countries or both. Between-country inequality measures use
        countries as units of observation. Within-country inequality research
        studies individuals within the nation-state. As we shall see, the effect
        of globalisation within countries differs from the effect of
        globalisation between countries. One difficulty with measuring
        inequality between countries is whether to weight countries based on
        population size or to treat them as equal units.
      </p>
      <p>
        A final problem for studying globalisation and inequality is how we
        compare different currencies across borders and time. There are two main
        approaches to calibrating incomes to a common comparative currency:
        purchasing-power-parity (PPP) adjusted income or market-exchange-rate
        adjusted income.[6]
      </p>
      <p>
        Why might globalisation affect inequality? The neoliberal or globalist
        argument says that globalisation has alleviated income inequality
        because increasing economic interdependence allocates resources more
        efficient as countries specialise in line with their comparative
        advantage.[7] This has lifted millions in the developing world out of
        poverty, reducing global inequality. Conversely, the standard
        anti-globalist argument asserts that globalisation has exacerbated
        inequality and global poverty, while wealthy countries and corporations
        pilfer the developing world.
      </p>
      <p>
        A review of the extant literature shows the evidence is argued in all
        directions. Inequality trends depend on which combination—out of many
        plausible combinations—of measures and countries we choose. Several
        studies suggest that world income inequality has been rising in the past
        two to three decades. World income distribution has become more unequal
        when incomes are measured at market exchanged rates and expressed in
        USD.[8] Similarly, studies of PPP-income polarization find income
        inequality increased when polarization is measured as richest to poorest
        decile. Milanovic, for example, finds the gap between the top and bottom
        declines has increased because the top decile has pulled up from the
        median while the bottom decile has fallen away from the median.[9]
        Furthermore, between country PPP-income inequality has increased since
        at least 1980 using GDP per capita and the Gini coefficient, when
        countries are weighted equally.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, studies using population-weighted PPP-income show
        inequality has been constant or falling since 1980.[10] This is the
        result that the neoliberal argument celebrates. However, this result is
        probably skewed by the relatively high weight of China and India, where
        inequality has sharply declined over the past 20 years.[11] Wade finds
        that when China and India are removed from the data set, this measure
        shows a pronounced widening.[12] This means that falling inequality is
        not a general feature of the world economy even by the most favourable
        measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several studies find that world PPP-income inequality has increased over
        a period within the last 20-30 years, factoring in both between- and
        within-country distributions. When we examine relative gain in real per
        capita income at different points of the global income distribution
        income, we see the gains of globalisation have been unequally
        distributed.[13] As shown in figure 3., the percentage gains are
        strongest among the middle class in emerging economies (point A), who
        are called the “global middle class” by Milanovic, and the global 1%
        (point C), called the Plutocrats. The gains are the least around the
        75–90th percentile of the global income distribution (point B).
        According to Milanovic, most of the groups around point A—the global
        middle class—are in emerging economies, especially Asia, whereas most
        groups around point B are the lower middle class of the rich world.[14]
        Consequently, we can infer that income inequality has increased mainly
        in middle- and high-income countries, and less so in low-income
        countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three problems with this finding. First, overall income growth
        is understated because of changing selection. The globally poor in 1988
        and 2008 are not necessarily the same groups of people. Second,
        different countries are included in the 1988 and 2008 datasets.
        According to Adam Corlett, when a consistent set of countries is used,
        there is a global average income growth of 32 percent rather than 24
        percent, and slow growth rather than stagnation for those around point
        B.[15] Third, uneven population shifts suppress the recorded income
        growth as part of the global distribution. Because the population of
        poorer countries has grown disproportionately and the population share
        of developed economies has shrunk, average incomes have been dragged
        down. However, if we take these figures at face value, it seems that
        within-country inequality is declining in developing countries but
        increasing in developed countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, whatever we conclude about relative income inequality, absolute
        income gaps are widening. Milanovic’s data shown in figure 3. below show
        that 25 percent of absolute gains in income between 1988 and 2008 went
        to the richest 5 percent of the world population.[16]
      </p>
      <p>
        Having reviewed the trends in global inequality, we arrive at the puzzle
        of whether globalisation has affected inequality. Because the data on
        global inequality are somewhat inconclusive, it may seem like a moot
        point to consider whether globalisation has a causal relationship to
        inequality. Yet we have seen there is an association between
        globalisation and an increase in income inequality in developed
        countries. According to Mills, globalisation has enhanced financial
        openness, trade, foreign direct investment, ICT capital investment and
        use, and the migration and mobility of labour. In industrialised
        countries this has exacerbated income inequality because of
        deindustrialisation, the weaker bargaining position of labour, capital
        flight, increased premium on high skills for knowledge-based industries,
        shift from higher wages in the industrial sector to lower wages in the
        service sector, and the rise in higher-skilled workers income. In
        developing countries, however, globalisation has decreased inequality
        due to industrialisation, capital arrival and new jobs, increased
        premium on lower skills for labour-intensive industries, increase in
        wages for lower-skilled workers, and a reduction in higher-skilled
        workers' income.[17]
