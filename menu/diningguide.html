        I'd like Wellington Dining Guide (our blog) to be Wellington's answer to
        Tyler's Ethnic Dining Guide. It's not the same though—it couldn't be if
        we tried. We bring our own context.
      </p>
      <p>Here's something Rudy and I wrote about our ethos:</p>
      <blockquote>
        We are two people who like food. We watched an embarrassing number of
        food shows as children, especially Anthony Bourdain and Rick Stein. We
        whakapapa to whānau who appreciate their kai. Rudy’s father was a
        sous-chef raised in the kitchen of his parent’s pub. Benjamin’s dad is a
        home cook hero with a special love for making pizza in the woodfire oven
        he built.<br /><br />
        We are two recent graduates. Rudy studied history and Benjamin studied
        economics. History and economics are useful tools for finding and
        appreciating good food. As Tyler Cowen has written, food is a product of
        economic supply and demand. To find good food, go where the supply is
        fresh, the suppliers are innovative, and the demanders are informed. One
        might say that everything else is commentary—but commentary is precisely
        what people look for in food writing and recommendations. Economics
        provides a topical, tactical sort of intel on food—the sort that allows
        a person to see the different angles but somehow entirely misses the
        point. While it’s helpful to have a comprehensive tactical knowledge of
        where the flour, vegetables, meat, spices, and financial capital that
        forms the foundation of your favourite, the sublime quality of eating
        well evades the grasp of this analysis. The historian's approach to
        storytelling casts a light on what is missing.<br /><br />
        We are also two people who love Wellington. It is a familiar love, like
        an old married couple. Familiarity breeds comfort and contempt in equal
        measures. It's a tired thing to say, but Wellington was once called "the
        coolest little capital in the world" by Lonely Planet. Something about
        that phrase reminds me of Jeff Daniel's iconic monologue in the pilot
        episode for Newsroom. To borrow Daniel's point, Wellington might not be
        that cool anymore, but it can be—and there are pockets of excellence
        worth celebrating.<br /><br />
        This guide aims to help you enjoy good food in Wellington and keep our
        favourite places in business. Effective consumer choice improves your
        eating and, in the long run, improves the quality of available
        restaurants. This guide is also intended to revive our romance with our
        old sweetheart. What better way than by taking her out for dinner?
