        This is where I keep track of my reading, reading lists made by other people,
        and that special category of aphorisms and witticims
        dedicated to reading and the curation of libraries.

      <h2>Aphorisms</h2>
      
      <p>
        A lot of great things have been said about books, how best to read, and
        the curation of one's (anti-)library. Here are some of my favourites:
      </p>

      <h4>Kathryn Shulz</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'Some people love books reverently—my great-aunt, for instance, a
        librarian and a passionate reader who declined to open any volume beyond
        a hundred-degree angle, so tenderly did she treat their spines. My
        father, by contrast, loved books ravenously. His always had a devoured
        look to them: scribbled on, folded over, cracked down the middle,
        liberally stained with coffee, Scotch, pistachio dust, and bits of the
        brightly colored shells of peanut M&Ms.'
      </blockquote><br>

           

      <h4>Georges Perec</h4>
       <blockquote>
         'Bookshelves should serve from time to time as joggers of the memory, as
        cat rests and as lumber rooms.'
       </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>John Milton</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'A good book is the precious life blood of a master spirit, embalmed and
        treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life.'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Carl Sagan</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a
        tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark
        squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another
        person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the
        millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head,
        directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions,
        binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant
        epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans
        are capable of working magic.'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Schopenhauer</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'In order to read what is good one must make it a condition never to
        read what is bad for life is short, and both time and strength is
        limited.'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <blockquote>
        'Writers can be divided into meteors, planets and fixed stars. The first
        produce a momentary effect: you gaze up, cry: "Look!"—and then they
        vanish forever. The second, the moving stars, endure for much longer. BY
        virtue of their proximity they often shine more brightly than the fixed
        stars, which the ignorant mistake them for. But they too must soon
        vacate their place, they shine moreover only with a borrowed light, and
        their sphere of influence is limited to their own fellow travellers
        (their contemporaries). The third alone are unchanging, standing firm in
        the firmament, shine by their own light and influence all ages equally,
        in that their aspect does not alter when our point of view alters since
        they have no parallax. Unlike the others, they do not belong to one
        system (nation) alone: they belong to the Universe. But it is precisely
        because they are so high that their light usually takes so many years to
        reach the eyes of dwellers on Earth.'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Francis Bacon</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'Some books should be tasted, some devoured, but only a few should be
        chewed and digested thoroughly.'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Umberto Eco</h4>
      <blockquote>
        ‘It could be said that they are still people who consider a bookshelf as
        a mere storage place for already-read books and do not think of the
        library as a working tool. But there is more to it than that. I believe
        that, confronted by a vast array of books, anyone will be seized by the
        anguish of learning, and will inevitably lapse into asking the question
        that expresses his torment and his remorse.’
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        On how best to answer when someone asks, “What a lot of books! Have you
        read them all?”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        ‘The best answer is the one always used by Roberto Leydig: “And more,
        dear sir, many more,” which freezes the adversary and plunges him into a
        state of awed admiration. But I find it merciless and angst-generating.
        Now I have fallen back on the riposte: “No, these are the ones I have to
        read by the end of the month. I keep the others in my office,” a reply
        that on the one hand suggests a sublime ergonomic strategy, and on the
        other leads the visitor to hasten the moment of his departure.’
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</h4>
      <blockquote>
        ‘The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your
        financial means . . . allow you to put there. You will accumulate more
        knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of
        unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the
        more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this
        collection of unread books an antilibrary.’
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        'Thinking you have to read all the unread books on your shelves before
        buying new ones is like thinking you should drink everything in the
        cellar before buying any new bottles. Some books just need a bit of
        shelf-time before they (/you) are ready'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Rebecca Solnit</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'The object we call a book is not the real book, but its potential, like
        a musical score or seed. It exists fully only in the act of being read;
        and its real home is inside the head of the reader, where the symphony
        resounds, the seed germinates. A book is a heart that only beats in the
        chest of another.'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Kafka</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us.
        If the book we’re reading doesn’t wake us up with a blow on the head,
        what are we reading it for? So that it will make us happy, as you write?
        Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind
        of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we
        had to. But we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that
        grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than
        ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a
        suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us. That is my
        belief.'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Chritopher Waltz</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'Comedy is like a cigar; it has to be <em>exquisite</em> to be any
        good.'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Kierkegaard</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'What then is education? I had thought it was the curriculum the
        individual ran through in order to catch up with himself, and anyone who
        does not want to go through this curriculum will be little helped by
        being born into the most enlightened age.'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Clive James</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'If you don't know the exact moment when the lights will go out, you
        might as well read until they do.'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Samuel Johnson</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'The reverence due to writings that have long subsisted arises therefore 
        not from any credulous confidence in the superior wisdom of past ages, 
        or gloomy persuasion of the degeneracy of mankind, but is the consequence of 
        acknowledged and indubitable positions, that what has been longest known 
        has been most considered, and what is most considered is best understood.'
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        'A man ought to read just as inclination leads him; for what he reads as 
        a task will do him little good.'
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        'A book may be good for nothing; or there may be only one thing in it worth 
        knowing; are we to read it all through?'
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>C.S. Lewis</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'Most of us do not believe that Dante’s universe is at all like the real one. 
        Most of us, in real life, would judge the emotion expressed in Donne’s Apparition 
        to be silly and degraded; even, what is worse, uninteresting. None of us can 
        accept simultaneously Housman’s and Chesterton’s views of life, or those of 
        Fitzgerald’s Omar and Kipling. What then is the good of—what is even the defence 
        for—occupying our hearts with stories of what never happened and entering vicariously 
        into feelings which we should try to avoid having in our own person? Or of fixing our 
        inner eye earnestly on things that can never exist—on Dante’s earthly paradise, Thetis 
        rising from the sea to comfort Achilles, Chaucer’s or Spenser’s Lady Nature, 
        or the Mariner’s skeleton ship?
<br></br>
        The nearest I have yet got to an answer is that we seek an enlargement of our being. 
        We are not content to be Leibnitzian monads. We demand windows. Literature as Logos 
        is a series of windows, even of doors. one of the things we feel after reading a 
        great work is “I have got out.” Or from another point of view, “I have got in”; 
        pierced the shell of some other monad and discovered what it is like inside.'
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        'In love we escape from our self into one other. In the moral sphere, every act of
        justice or charity involves putting ourselves in the other person’s place and thus 
        transcending our own competitive particularity. In coming to understand anything we are
        rejecting the facts as they are for us in favour of the facts as they are.
        The primary impulse of each is to maintain and aggrandise himself. The secondary impulse is to
        go out of the self, to correct its provincialism and heal its loneliness. 
        In love, in virtue, in the pursuit of knowledge, and in the reception of the arts, we are doing this. 
        Obviously this process can be described either as an enlargement or as a temporary
        annihilation of the self. But that is an old paradox; “he that loseth his life shall save it”.'
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        ⁠If we take literature in the widest sense, so as to include the literature 
        both of knowledge and of power, the question “What is the good of reading what anyone writes?”
        is very like the question “What is the good of listening to what anyone says?”
        Unless you contain in yourself sources that can supply all the information,
        entertainment, advice, rebuke and merriment you want, the answer is obvious. 
        And if it is worth while listening or reading at all, it is often worth doing so. 
      </blockquote><br>
      <blockquote>
        'Literature enlarges our being by admitting us to experiences not our own. 
        They may be beautiful, terrible, awe-inspiring, exhilarating, pathetic, comic, or merely piquant. 
        Literature gives the entree to them all. Those of us who have been true readers all our life, 
        seldom fully realize the enormous extension of our being which we owe to authors. We realize 
        it best when we talk with an unliterary friend. He may be full of goodness and good sense, 
        but he inhabits a tiny world. In it, we should be suffocated. My own eyes are not enough 
        for me. The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison.
        My own eyes are not enough for me ... Even the eyes of all humanity are not enough. 
        I regret that the brutes cannot write books. Very gladly would I learn what face things 
        present to a mouse or a bee; more gladly still would I perceive the olfactory world charged with 
        all the information and emotion it carries for a dog... . In reading good literature, I become a 
        thousand men, and yet remain myself. Like the night sky in a Greek poem, I see with a myriad eyes, 
        but it is still I who see. Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I
        transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do.
      </blockquote><br>
      
      <h4>Henry Oliver</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'Find as many books as possible that you can re-read every decade. 
        You are looking for writing that you will never get over.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        'Memorise the things you love. Wallow. Swoon. When you are walking down the street
        and feel overcome with a line of Wallace Stevens just say it out loud to yourself. 
        Why not? One day you’ll be dead and you won’t get the chance.
        Listen to poets reading their own work wherever possible. Chant it to yourself.<br>

      <h4>Harold Bloom</h4>

        'You can read merely to pass the time, or you can read with an overt urgency,

        we call "falling in love." I urge you to find what truly comes near to you,
        that can be used for weighing and for considering. Read  deeply, not to believe, not
        to accept, not to contradict, but to learn to share in that one nature that writes and reads.'

      <h4>Nietzsche</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'That for which we can find words is something already dead in our hearts.'
      </blockquote><br>

      <h4>G.K. Chesterton</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'Romance is the deepest thing in life; romance is deeper even than reality.⁠⁠
        ⁠⁠For even if reality could be proved to be misleading, it still could
        not be proved to be unimportant or unimpressive. Even if
        the facts are false, they are still very strange.'
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        'People wonder why the novel is the most popular form of literature;
        people wonder why it is read more than books of science or books of metaphysics. The reason is
        very simple; it is merely that the novel is more true than they are. Life
        may sometimes legitimately appear as a book of science. Life may sometimes appear,
        and with a much greater legitimacy, as a book of metaphysics. But life is always a novel.⁠⁠ '
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        '⁠⁠Our existence may cease to be a song; it may cease even to be a
        beautiful lament. Our existence may not be an intelligible justice, or even are
        cognizable wrong. But our existence is still a story⁠⁠.
        ⁠⁠In the fiery alphabet of every sunset is written, “to be continued in our next.”⁠⁠ '
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        '⁠⁠If we have sufficient intellect, we can finish a philosophical and exact
        deduction, and be certain that we are finishing it right. With the adequate brain-power we
        could finish any scientific discovery, and be certain that we were finishing it right. But not
        with the most gigantic intellect could we finish the simplest or silliest
        story, and be certain that we were finishing it right. That is because a story
        has behind it, not merely intellect which is partly mechanical,
        but will, which is in its essence divine.⁠'
      </blockquote><br>

      <h4>Jane Austen</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.'
      </blockquote><br>

      <h4>Katherine Rundell</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'There is, though, a sense among most adults that we should only read in one direction,
        because to do otherwise would be to regress or retreat: to de-mature. 
        You pass Spot the Dog, battle past that bicephalic monster Peter and Jane; 
        through Narnia, on to <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> or Patrick Ness, and from there to adult 
        fiction, where you remain, triumphant, never glancing back, because to glance back 
        would be to lose ground.
        <br><br>
        But the human heart is not a linear train ride. That isn’t how people actually read; 
        at least, it’s not how I’ve ever read. I learned to read fairly late, with much strain and agonising until,
        at last and quite suddenly, the hieroglyphs took shape and meaning: 
        and then I read with the same omnivorous un-scrupulosity I showed at mealtimes. I read <em>Matilda</em> 
        alongside <em>Jane Austen</em>, <em>Narnia</em> and Agatha Christie; I took Diana Wynne Jones’s 
        <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> with me to university, clutched tight to my chest like a life raft. 
        I still read <em>Paddington</em> when I need to believe, as Michael Bond does, that the world’s 
        miracles are more powerful than its chaos. For reading not to become something that
        we do for anxious self-optimisation – for it not to be akin to buying high-spec trainers
        and a gym membership each January – all texts must be open, to all people.'
      </blockquote><br>

      <h4>Borges</h4>
      <blockquote>
        'There are many ways of living, and reading is one of them... 
        When you are reading, you are living, and when you are dreaming, you are living also.'

      <h4>Logal Pearsall Smith</h4>
