      <h3>The joy of taking a short book on a long walk</h3>

      <p>
        Prospective holidays are refuges in our imaginations. When we imagine
        ourselves holidaying we imagine ourselves stress-free, well-rested, and
        energetic without relying on caffeine. We imagine that we will have time
        to do all those things which we had hoped to do, but couldn’t because of
        the demands of quotidian existence. Imaginary holidays are repositories
        for things one would do “if only I had more time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Typically I take too many books with me on holiday. (This is such a
        universally shared experience, there must be a German word for packing
        too many books into too small a suitcase). Throughout the rest of the
        year I read steadily enough, but the growing tower of unread books
        leaning over my bed stares at me menacingly like a sleep paralysis demon
        scratching at my bedpost to mark the seconds counting down towards my
        death. To keep my mortal despair at bay, I’ll assure myself that while
        holidaying I can read <em>Paradise Lost</em>, <em>Moby Dick</em>, and
        <em>David Copperfield</em> in one week and still have time to rearrange
        a living room and eat a Fruju.
      </p>

      <p>
        I kept this dysfunctional behaviour up until I walked the Routeburn
        track. I was packing light, so I chose between two small books: either
        Schopenhauer's Essays & Aphorisms or Shakespeare’s sonnets. I packed the
        sonnets—a small, slim, almost-square orange book that could be mistaken
        for a coaster.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the joys of taking short books filled with small things, like
        poems or aphorisms, on a long walk is that they are well suited to the
        logistical demands of traveling. In his essay, <em>On Reading</em>,
        Montaigne expounds his love for Plutarch and Seneca:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        'They both are strikingly suited to my humour in that the knowledge that
        I seek from them is treated in pieces not sewn together (and so do not
        require me to bind myself to some lengthy labour, of which I am quite
        incapable) . . . I do not need a great deal of preparation to get down
        to them and I can drop them whenever I like, for one part of them does
        not really lead to another.'
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        When you’ve reached the hut and you’ve unrolled your sleeping bag, hung
        your clothes out to dry, and changed into something cozier, you can read
        a little—just a little. You can slip into the bath without getting your
        hair wet.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second joy of taking a short book on a long walk is the connection
        it creates between a book and a place. Like a summer romance, the charm
        of the book is inseparable from the place where we read it. And like
        re-reading a love letter, when we return to the book we are transported
        through time to a precious version of the place that exists only in our
        memory, unblemished.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third great joy of taking a short book on a long walk is that you
        can take the time to worry at it, sink your teeth into it, and chew it
        slowly. YouTube is filled with videos with names like “How reading one
        book every week changed my life,” “How to Read Faster,” “Why I read a
        book a day (and so should you!)”. The cult of reading books faster isn’t
        really about learning. It’s about signaling and it’s inspired by a
        theory of learning that says the more information you can pour into your
        head the more you’re going to learn. But learning isn’t that simple.
        Schopenhauer says that...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        'Thoughts put down on paper are nothing more than footprints in the
        sand: one sees the road the man has taken, but in order to know what he
        saw on the way, one requires his eyes.'
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        We must labour to understand a book. By taking a short book on a long
        walk you have time to read and re-read it, looking closer and closer
        still at each time of passing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        'Only through ordering what you know by comparing truth with every other
        truth can you take complete possession of your knowledge and get it into
        your power. You can think about only what you know, so you ought to
        learn something; on the other hand, you can know only what you have
        thought about.' <br />
        <br />
        —Schopenhauer, <em>On Thinking For Yourself</em>

          >Against my love shall be as I am now,<br />With Time's injurious hand
          crushed and o'erworn;<br />When hours have drained his blood and
          filled his brow<br />With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful
          morn<br />Hath travelled on to age's steepy night;<br />And all those
          beauties whereof now he's king<br />Are vanishing, or vanished out of
          sight,<br />Stealing away the treasure of his spring;<br />For such a
          time do I now fortify<br />Against confounding age's cruel knife,<br />That
          he shall never cut from memory<br />My sweet love's beauty, though my
          lover's life:</em

      <p><em>His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,</em></p>

      <p><em> And they shall live, and he in them still green.</em></p>
