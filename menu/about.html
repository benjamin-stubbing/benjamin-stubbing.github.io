      <p><b>Benjamin Stubbing</b></p>

      <p>
        I was born at a very young age in Auckland, New Zealand. Nowadays you’ll find me in Wellington where I work for the Treasury in the Analytics and Insights team. We undertake research and analysis on social and economic issues, looking for new and better ways for the public service to improve outcomes for New Zealanders.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m enthusiastic about creating a future of abundance: building a materially healthy society that nourishes welfare, ameliorating  places where bad rules impede the common good, and growing the things that make a nation great and the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I’ve worked as a management consultant for PwC and as a
        research assistant at Victoria University, the Human Rights Measurement
        Initiative (HRMI), and the Ministry of Education.
      </p>
      <p>
        To let off steam, I participate in full-contact Origami and I play
        tennis. I dabble in classical guitar and from time to time I reprise my
        violin-playing after a fashion. On occasion I’ve been known to act and
        emcee.

        On weekends, I circulate an old-school <a href="https://benjaminstubbing.substack.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">links blast</a> and read <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KL3Ung7reIdBaDlK3LkV5zmfuP8y-q6zHt0PIKVGFBw/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very slowly</a>
