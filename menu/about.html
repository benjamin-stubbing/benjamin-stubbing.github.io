        Born at a very young age in Auckland, New Zealand, nowadays you’ll find me in Wellington where I work for the Treasury in the Analytics and Insights team. We apply modelling and analytical expertise to transform data into policy insights, with a focus on microdata and microsimulation.

        I’m enthusiastic about creating a future of abundance: building a materially healthy society that nourishes welfare, ameliorating  places where bad rules impede the common good, and growing the things that make a nation great and the world a better place. ie, in Ezra Klein's words, the “stupidly simple” thesis that “to have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of the things that we need.”

      My chief vice has always been having too many interests; I love learning about anything and everything.* Take a look at my <a href="/menu/bookshelf.html">Bookshelf</a> and <a href="/menu/writing.html">Writing</a>, e.g. <a href="https://cream-lift-9ad.notion.site/The-Coolest-Things-I-Learned-in-2024-in-no-particular-order-17206aff89f280a7903ae877e90aea5f?pvs=4" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

      <p><b>More about me</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ko te rarawa, ko ngai takoto, ko Ngati-Awa-Nui-a-Rangi aku iwi. Kei Tamaki Makaurau taku kāinga.</li>
        <li>Previously I’ve worked as a management consultant for PwC (briefly) and as a research assistant at Victoria University, the Human Rights Measurement Initiative (based in <a href="https://www.motu.nz/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motu</a>), and the NZ Ministry of Education.</li>
        <li>To let off steam, I regularly have it handed to me in <a href="https://cream-lift-9ad.notion.site/Notes-on-BJJ-11206aff89f280ff8d40d154c3f1490a?pvs=4" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-contact Origami</a>, I play
        tennis with mildly more success, and on ocassion I dabble in violin and guitar after a fashion.</li>
        <li>Alongside work I'm studying an Honours degree in economics. As an undergrad I studied philosophy, politics, and economics. (Hayek used to say that nobody can be a great economist who is only an economist and that the economist who is only an economist is likely to become a nuisance if not a positive danger. In many respects Hayek was a prick). I focused on econometrics, quantitative comparative politics, and political philosophy.</li>
        <li>On weekends, I circulate an old-school <a href="https://benjaminstubbing.substack.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">links blast</a> and I read <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KL3Ung7reIdBaDlK3LkV5zmfuP8y-q6zHt0PIKVGFBw/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very slowly</a>.</li>
        <li>Some of my favourite books are: <em>Dracula</em>, <em>Anna Karenina</em>, <em>Reasons and Persons</em>, and <em>The Man Who Was Thursday</em>.</li>
        <li>Here's a repository of <a href="https://cream-lift-9ad.notion.site/Rules-for-life-746c0587080a427d9f1cf1ce5079021a" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wisdom</a> I've amassed, infinitely wise being that I am.</li>
        <li>If you don't know me (or don't know me that well) and you get the impression that we'd get along, feel free to email me: benstubbing(at)gmail(dot)com. </li>
        <li>I like this thing Frank Ramsey said:</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>My picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The foreground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny bits.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>*Somehow the guy who’s really interested in absolutely everything is really boring.</blockquote>
